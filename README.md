# alias-add
Python tool to permanently add aliases for bash and zsh for those who don't want to hand edit config files. Pretty much what it says on the tin.

Works with Python 3.x, no dependencies required. 

You can get alias-add with IPFS. Download IPFS at https://ipfs.io/#install or with snapd, homebrew, or chocolatey.
