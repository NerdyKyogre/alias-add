# alias-add
Python tool to permanently add aliases for bash and zsh for those who don't want to hand edit config files. Also appends lines to shell RC afterwards.

Works with Python 3.x, no dependencies required.

If your system has a link at /home/root not pointing to /root and you need to edit root's shell rc, use v0.0.1

You can get alias-add with IPFS. Download IPFS at https://ipfs.io/#install or with snapd, homebrew, or chocolatey.
